A CSV file is a thing so neat,
Rows and columns, all so fleet,
Data arranged in a structured way,
So easy to read, like a summer day.

Commas and quotes, they play a part,
Separating values, and not too smart,
But with some care, and a little art,
A CSV file can be a work of heart.

Columns for dates, and columns for names,
Numbers and text, they're all fair game,
A little bit of everything, in just the right place,
A CSV file, like a smile on your face.

Load it up, and watch it go,
Sorting and filtering, with a flow,
The power of data, in your hands,
Thanks to CSV, we can understand.

So here's to CSV, a format divine,
Simple and elegant, yet oh so fine,
A world of data, waiting to be seen,
All thanks to CSV, our guiding beam.
